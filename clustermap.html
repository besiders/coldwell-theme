The lots are just a few minute walk to the white sandy beach of Playa Avellanas and Lola\u2019s restaurant.\\nThe property\\nThis lot is just over 700m2 which translates to just under a 1\/4 acre. \u00a0This property comes with building plans. Each owner is welcome to build their home using the developers plans or their own. There are no HOA fees. This lot is one of the least expensive and most manageable in the entire area. This lot also has a small creek at the rear of the lot that has running water during the rainy season. This lot has the highest elevation of all in the project.\\nThe area\\nFor years and years Avellanas was know to be a sleepy beach. There were hardly any residents. There were less businesses in the area. However, in the last ten years, Avellanas beach has seen a slow residential growth. There are many new homes and residents here. Most came because it afforded them the opportunity to be close to Tamarindo but still be far enough away from the hustle and bustle. Avellanas beach is one of the most impressive in the area. It stretches just over a mile long and is coveted for its beautiful white sands. There is an enormous estuary system here that leads up to the beach so there will never be any homes peering out from the woods. This will be Avellanas\u2019s biggest advantage for the future because the beauty of the beach will be preserved from beachfront development. This beach is known to be one of the best surfing beaches in the area for beginners to experts.\\nFiresale\\nDon\u2019t let this one of kind opportunity pass you by.

Howler Monkey\u2019s will use this natural corridor to wake you and let you know it is time for breakfast. Myriad bird species will flutter through the canopy (we had an Audubon Christmas count a few years back and documented more than 200 species). \\n\\nThis \u00a0lovely property has many different natural building pads. One of the best looks over the creek area. The property is\u00a0located inside a small and private gated community. All the lots in this community are estate sized giving each home plenty of privacy. The building footprint for this lot is an astounding 13,200fts (1317m\u00b2). It is only 5 minutes away from the beaches of Junquillal, Callejones, or Playa Negra. The lot is one of the few in the area that is serviced with public water. The paved road to all points is only 5 minutes away as well. This property is a spectacular piece of Costa Rica beach real estate. A place where you can plant roots, plan a retirement, or just get away from it all here at the beach.

O.k. Eco is a term that has taken quite a hold in our lives and vocabularies. Without a doubt, it is one of the most overused monikers that is used to define a development. However, this development in Junquillal, Tierra Pacifica, is just that \u2013 an ecological minded residential community. Why? There are many reasons. Let\u2019s start with the easy ones. There was no slash and burn here! The lots were all segregated with nature and the natural contours of the land. They have kept all the trees in this development, even the small ones. They have installed special landscaping methods to help with erosion control. They created a lake to insure that runoff during the rainy season would percolate into the ground. They have designated naturally low lying areas to green spaces. There is also a designated area for organic farming. They are so eco here that a few years back an Audubon Society Christmas bird count successfully counted nearly 240 bird species.\\n\\nThe Developments Amenities\\nThey have more amenities in this development than the majority in the area. They built a large community centre here. You will find a very large fully equipped and air conditioned gym here. There are ample bathrooms and changing areas. There is a three tiered swimming pool with large jacuzzi adjacent to the tennis courts. There is a huge outdoor barbecue area along with a fully equipped kitchen. They also have a dedicated computer room and large roofed entry with tables for organising a party. The development has plenty of green areas that are accessed through miles of manicured walking trails. They are only a few hundred meters to the ocean and there is a walking trail for accessing it directly. Conveniently located at the front of the development is a large commercial centre with the area\u2019s largest grocery store. Naturally, there is electricity, internet, 3G cel service, and telephone. All cables run underground in order to protect wildlife.\\n\\nThe Lot\\nthis lot is one and a quarter acres. It is one of the highest lots in the community and it is quite likely that you will be able to glimpse the ocean from a roof top widow\u2019s walk or terrace. The gently slopes up from the road so accessing your lovely home will be a breeze. Terracing the property won\u2019t be a necessity. There is a natural large building pad at the top which could easily accommodate a 5000ft2 home. The building footprint on this lot is around 9000ft2.","propertyDescription_es":"","propertyHomeOwnerNote":null,"propertyPriceCurrency":"USD","propertyPrice":"59990","propertyPriceDay":null,"propertyPriceWeek":"0","propertyPriceMonth":"0","propertyBed":"0.0","propertyBath":"0.0","propertyBuilt":"0","propertyLand":"5838.00","propertyFloor":"0.00","propertyDayMarket":"907","propertyAddress":"Tierra Pacifica Junquillal","propertyState":"Guanacaste","propertyCity":"Guan_Junquillal","propertyCityLabel":"Junquillal","propertyCountry":"Costa Rica","propertyLatitude":"10.167903","propertyLongitude":"-85.804355","propertyPictureCount":"20","propertyVideoCount":"1","propertyUrlTiny":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/propertybase-clients\/00Dd0000000donbEAA\/a0Cd000000UoSW5\/p196sd3fse1sm41cml6b51l111lfl10\/thumbnail\/untitled-1729-11.JPG","propertyUrlSmall":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/cbcr\/image\/propertyFile\/a0Cd000000UoSW5EAN\/small\/a0Bd000000uNOnbEAG.jpeg","propertyUrlMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/propertybase-clients\/00Dd0000000donbEAA\/a0Cd000000UoSW5\/p196sd3fse1sm41cml6b51l111lfl10\/midres\/untitled-1729-11.JPG","propertyUrlCarousel":null,"propertyUrlFlickr":null,"propertyStatus":"Active","propertyDateCreated":"2014-11-16","propertyDateLastModified":"2017-05-11 17:52:45","propertyOrderBy":"0","propertyAgentOffice":"Tamarindo","propertyAgentCompany":"Coldwell Banker Tamarindo Realty","propertyAgentFirstName":"Larry","propertyAgentLastName":"Graziano CIPS","propertyAgentEmail":"larry@cbtamarindo.com","propertyAgentPhone":"+506-2653-1919","propertyAgentMobile":"+506-8835-2977","propertyAgentPicture":""},{"officeSort":"20","propertyNum":"6516","salesforcePropertyId":"a0Cd000000qbJNhEAM","salesforceListingId":"a09d000001EUwuoAAD","salesforcePropertyGroupId":null,"propertyId":"7300","propertyType":"Land","propertyCategory":"Sale","propertyAuthority":"Exclusive","propertyGroupName":null,"propertyFeature":"Acreage;Beach Properties;Jungle Views;Mountain Properties;Mountain View","propertyFeature_es":null,"propertyTitleUrl":"lot-19-samara-woods","propertyTitle":"Lot 19 Samara Woods","propertyTitle_es":null,"propertyDescription":"Beautiful and spacious lot in the Samara Woods residential community.
